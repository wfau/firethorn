    MySQL should be ok.

    "For compatibility with PostgreSQL, MySQL also supports the LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset syntax."

Jesus Salgado

    Sybase has problems with this.

    The possibility to combine LIMIT and OFFSET to control (paginate) results could be quite useful.
    
    This was also one of our (ESA) ADQL evolution requirements.

François-Xavier Pineau, Laurent Michel
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007242.html

    To be useful, OFFSET should be used with ORDER BY.
    
    Using LIMIT, ORDER BY and OFFSET may not be the best way to harvest a large table.

    Having said this does not means that we are against its implementation in ADQL.

    MSSQL Server - does support OFFSET, no support for LIMIT.

Gerard Lemson
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007244.html
 
    MSSQL Server uses FETCH instead of LIMIT
    
        SELECT select_list
        FROM table_expression
        [ORDER BY ... [OFFSET number ROWS [FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY]]

    (*) should the LIMIT/FETCH pattern be included? If so I'd vote for using the term FETCH rather than LIMIT and that we'd include the restriction that TOP must not be combined with OFFSET...FETCH (as in SQLServer).
    (**) assuming ADQL will allow OFFSET only in the ORDER BY clause, otherwise mapping to SQLServer would become too ugly, and arguably it only makes sense in that context.

        [ORDER BY ... [OFFSET number FETCH number]]
    
Tom McGlynn
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007245.html

    While ORDER BY is a necessary condition it is not sufficient.  The 
    value of the expression must be unique in each row to guarantee a fixed 
    ordering.
     
    So my feeling is that we shouldn't go out of our way to couple OFFSET 
    and ORDER BY.


    The SQL 2008 standard construct is

        OFFSET start ROW[S]

    In the vein of the previous comment, we might also consider adding 
    support for the standard

        FETCH FIRST count ROWS ONLY

    as a standard if verbose synonym for TOP.
    
    I don't like the idea of adding support for LIMIT since it is another
    non-standard keyword, though since the HEASARC's TAP is running in
    Postgres it's easy enough for us to support.

Gerard Lemson
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007248.html

    On MSSQL Server

        FAILS
        ORDER BY 'x' OFFSET 10 ROWS

        WORKS
        ORDER BY 0*<numerical column> OFFSET 10 ROWS

    But I would now like to see the reason for introducing this clause at all without ORDER BY.

Markus Demleitner
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007249.html

    In terms of whether OFFSET makes sense without ORDER BY: I think
    that's really a moot point since ADQL has allowed TOP without ORDER BY
    since the beginning, which is exactly as questionable.

    .... OFFSET is a classical case of an 80% solution: it's probably good
    enough for doing some things in 80% of the situations and miserably
    fails for the remaining 20% (which of course would require at least
    80% of the work for a comprehensive solution).

    .... I agree with Tom that we should have a long hard look at what
    SQL 2000 standard says

    .... adding OFFSET 0 systematically certainly is not a good idea

Mark Taylor
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007250.html

    TOP is just if you want a result but you don't want it too big.

    Non-ORDERed OFFSET would on the other hand presumably be used to
    provide pagination. 

    The problem there is that you might get different orderings for
    different queries, so end up with duplicate or missing records.

Gerard Lemson
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007252.html

    Just wanted to voice my support for Mark's use case, which is exactly the
    way I use TOP: to see an example of the data, generally used without ordering.

Dave Morris
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007264.html

    I agree there is a good case for accepting OFFSET.

    As to the syntax, I agree with Tom, ideally we want to keep as close as 
    possible to the SQL 2008 standard.

    I think that on its own the case for linking OFFSET to ORDER BY on 
    efficiency grounds is not strong enough to justify diverging from the 
    SQL standard.

    A number of platforms only allow OFFSET as part of a LIMIT construct, so 
    we will need to find a way for them to implement it.

    Assuming we find a syntax that will work on all the platforms, I'm happy 
    to include OFFSET as optional in 2.1 with the option to look at making 
    it mandatory in 3.x.

Markus Demleitner
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007270.html

    It turns out there's publicly available material (i.e., late working drafts) on that at
    http://www.wiscorp.com/SQLStandards.html.  And that tells me that:

    <query expression> ::=
      [ <with clause> ] <query expression body>
      [ <order by clause> ] [ <result offset clause> ] 
      [ <fetch first clause> ]
    (pdfp. 427)

    -- so, offset and order by are not linked in SQL 2008.  Also,

    <result offset clause> ::=
      OFFSET <offset row count> { ROW | ROWS }

    -- so they have the stupid "row" thing, and, if I read their version
    of BNF correctly, it's even mandatory.

    Also,

    <offset row count> ::=
      <simple value specification>

    and <simple value specification> can be all kinds of messy things ("SQL
    parameter reference", "embedded variable name", oh my).

    As a service for the SQLServer folks whom I wouldn't want to force to
    insert artificial ORDER BY clauses, I'm fine with hanging OFFSET off
    of <order by clause> (which, conversely means that ADQL query writers
    may have to add "artificial" order bys; but that's probably a good
    idea anyway, even if it may mean some extremely whacky applications
    relying on implementation details might become impossible).

    The result would be, for ADQL,

    <order_by_clause> ::= 

        ORDER BY <sort_specification_list> <result offset clause>

    <result offset clause> ::=

        OFFSET <unsigned integer>

    -- which is a relevant simplification, in particular restricting
    ourselves to unsigned integers, but I propose that's a good idea.
    Dropping the ROW[S], however, makes this not even a proper subset of
    SQL 2008.  So, if anyone stands up and says "let's keep the ROW[S]",
    I'll have no choice but to concur.

    > A number of platforms only allow OFFSET as part of a LIMIT construct, so we
    > will need to find a way for them to implement it.

    if that is true just inserting an absurdly large LIMIT in the query morpher
    would be a general and IMHO acceptable workaround.

Walter Landry
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007271.html

    Let's keep the ROW[S].  We should not make it gratuitously different
    from SQL.

Mark Taylor
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007272.html

    Yeah.  Instead of the reek of COBOL, try thinking of it as retro chic.

Markus Demleitner
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007273.html

    That certainly makes it more palatable, yes.  So, it would be

    <order_by_clause> ::= 

        ORDER BY <sort_specification_list> [ <result offset clause> ]

    <result offset clause> ::=

        OFFSET <unsigned integer> (ROW|ROWS)

Walter Landry
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007263.html

    I would like to add that I support this in the general sense of making
    it possible to do more sophisticated analysis on the server.

    On Oracle 11g, we can workaround it to some degree by rewriting the
    query to use rownum

        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2912144/alternatives-to-limit-and-offset-for-paging-in-oracle#2912182
        http://www.jooq.org/doc/3.5/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/select-statement/limit-clause/

    However, the solution that those links propose does add a column.  So
    if a user made a query like

        select ra,dec from fp_psc limit 10 offset 13

    it gets turned into

        select * from
          (
          select ra, dec, rownnum as rn from fp_psc
          )
        where rn >= 13 and rn <= 10+13

Gerard Lemson
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007239.html

    Thanks for suggesting this, as it inspired me to check up on sqlserver where I found it has had OFFSET since version 2012.
    Syntax is (see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg699618(v=sql.110).aspx):

        [ORDER BY { order_by_expression [ ASC | DESC ] } [ ,...n][<offset_fetch>] ]

        <offset_fetch> ::= {OFFSET { integer_constant | offset_row_count_expression } { ROW | ROWS }    [FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } {integer_constant | fetch_row_count_expression } { ROW | ROWS } ONLY]}

    Most important difference is the requirement that it be part of an ORDER BY clause,
    which I think makes sense as without that you cannot in general rely on consistent
    ordering between consecutive requests. Would that be OK with you, all?

Gerard Lemson
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007246.html

    I just now tied this on CasJobs' SQLServer and the error message says: 'A constant expression was encountered in the ORDER BY list'
    What was accepted was ' ORDER BY 0*<numerical column> OFFSET 10 ROWS'

    But I would now like to see the reason for introducing this clause at all without ORDER BY.

Gilles Landais
http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/2016-January/007253.html

    Concerning the offset option in ADQL.
    This option is friendly in ADQL, but the implementation will be more 
    difficult in particular for big tables (as Francois Xavier said: it 
    needs to reorder the result).

    This option is clearly interesting for pagination.
    Could we considered to push this pagination capability in UWS?
    UWS is may be not dedicated for tables; however a UWS capability 
    allowing to get a "cut" of a result (delimited by an offset of lines or 
    an option to split the result) could be an other solution?
